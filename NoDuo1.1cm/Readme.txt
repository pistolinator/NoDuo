// This is the documentation for the NoDuo app, created by Fletcher Wells


Setup Instructions:
-Your computer may not allow you to open NoDuo because it is from an "unidentified developer." (I apologize for not paying for a developer certificate.) To fix this, go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General -> Open Anyway -> Open. Then force quit the NoDuo app by pressing option-command-esc, choosing NoDuo from the menu, then clicking the force-quit button.
-Also, make sure Messages is set up on your computer.
-IMPORTANT and required for macOS MOJAVE and higher: Go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Full Disk Access -> + -> then locate and select the NoDuo1.1cm app under the downloads or applications folder. Repeat this process for the accessibility tab under Security & Privacy -> Privacy.
-If any windows appear requesting access for NoDuo1.1cm, click allow access.


Usage Instructions:
-Before using NoDuo, refresh the BuckeyePass page. Do not click any where else on the page. Then open the NoDuo app.
-DO NOT CLICK ANYWHERE OR TOUCH YOUR KEYBOARD while the NoDuo app is running.
-The NoDuo app should close on its own. If it doesn't, then that version of NoDuo either no longer works or you clicked or typed something while the program was running. 
-If the NoDuo app is no longer working, download an updated version at www.fletcherwells.com/noduo.


Explanation for NoDuo's behavior:
-NoDuo uses key inputs. This means that if you click anywhere else while the program is running, the key inputs may not be inputted correctly, causing the app not to work. This also means that NoDuo is very finicky. If OSU updates the format of their website, NoDuo will stop working. If this happens, I'll try to post an update version to www.fletcherwells.com/noduo as quickly as possible.
-Also note that NoDuo uses Messages, so you must have your Apple Messages account set up to use NoDuo.
-If you rename the NoDuo application, it will no longer close automatically.
